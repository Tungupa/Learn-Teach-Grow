This repository will work as a catch-all for all my scripts. Since I am new to the scripting world/Github,
I do not have a ton of scripts to be seperated into different repositories. I am also learning how to utilize 
Github and may eventual adjust it to my needs. Any comments, suggestions and advice is welcome. Thanks!
