This repository will work as a catch-all for all my scripts. Since I am new to the scripting world/Github,
I do not have a ton of scripts to be separated into different repositories. I am also learning how to utilize 
Github and may eventually adjust it to my needs. Any comments, suggestions and advice is welcomed. Let's learn, teach and grow together!
